This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing loan data using Python. Utilizing the powerful libraries Matplotlib and Seaborn, we explore the data to uncover insights and patterns related to loan applications, approvals, and defaults.
The dataset comprises loan information, including attributes such as loan amount, interest rates, borrower details, loan status, and more. The data has been collected from financial institutions and is preprocessed to ensure quality and consistency.

Tools and Libraries:
Python: The main programming language for data analysis.
Matplotlib: A versatile library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
Seaborn: A high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics, built on top of Matplotlib.

Key Analyses:
Loan Approval Analysis: Visualizing the distribution of approved vs. rejected loans and identifying factors that influence approval rates.
Interest Rate Trends: Analyzing how interest rates vary across different loan types and borrower profiles.
Default Risk Assessment: Examining patterns in loan defaults and identifying key risk factors.
